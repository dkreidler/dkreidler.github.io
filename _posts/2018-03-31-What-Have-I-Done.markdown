OK, apparently I need to learn how to use Jekyll, too. 

The end goal will be to import code from CodePen, personally hosted and developed
projects, and stuff here on GitHub, and create an actual portfolio.

Things to add:
    -CodePen Portfolio created for FreeCodeCamp front-end training
        --(Note - update portfolio section...)
    -Strength App - form interface and resulting polar and/or radar plots
    -React audio player from scotch.io tutorial
       -- Note about how the tutorial was mostly about how to hook together various elements, NOT the actual player or graphics... or, you know, the heart of the thing.
     

Right now, there's just THIS mess. Welcome. Pull up a chair...or a box.

Or something.
